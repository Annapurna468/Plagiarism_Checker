This project implements a text similarity detection system to identify potential plagiarism among multiple documents. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and cosine similarity to compare documents based on their textual content.

✅ Features
Preprocessing of raw text (tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization)

TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features

Cosine similarity calculation to measure the degree of similarity between documents

Identification and display of document pairs with high similarity scores

Visualization of similarity matrices for easier interpretation

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

scikit-learn

pandas

nltk

matplotlib / seaborn (for visualizations)

🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository or download the notebook.

Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
(You can create requirements.txt with packages like scikit-learn, pandas, nltk, matplotlib)

Place the text documents you want to check into the data/ folder.

Open the notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook "Plagiarism_check.ipynb"
Follow the notebook steps to preprocess data, compute similarity, and view results.

📊 Results
The tool computes cosine similarity scores between documents and visualizes them in a heatmap. Document pairs with high similarity scores are flagged as potential plagiarism cases.

✏️ Future Improvements
Add a user interface for uploading and comparing documents.

Support other languages and multilingual datasets.

Enhance preprocessing with advanced NLP techniques (e.g., stemming, synonym handling).

Provide detailed reports highlighting matched text segments.
